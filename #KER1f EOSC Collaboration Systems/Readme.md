# Description
Internal tools needed to coordinate EOSC-Core and EOSC-Exchange operations. These include collaborative information management (e.g. a wiki and document database - Confluence), task and issue tracking (i.e. a ticketing system supporting workflows - Jira), and communication management (e.g. email, chat, mailing list, and video conferencing - MS Teams). While individual organisations may have these capabilities, they will be needed at a larger scale to support EOSC-Core and EOSC-Exchange operations.

This result is a blueprint of how services may be provisioned and used to coordinate activities in delivering the EOSC Platform. A copy of the tools' contents is stored in case the information is required for possible use during the implementation of the EOSC EU node as part of the EC EOSC procurement.
