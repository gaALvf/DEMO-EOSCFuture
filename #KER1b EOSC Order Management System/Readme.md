System to manage orders for services made through the central EOSC marketplace (directly from researcher-facing portal or potentially passed from other catalogues which display services pulled from the central catalogue). Collects customer/user requests with relevant data and passes these to providers via API, email, or other means. Supports collection of order metrics.
(In the Core Service Portfolio, the Order Management System is part of the EOSC Catalogue and Marketplace)
