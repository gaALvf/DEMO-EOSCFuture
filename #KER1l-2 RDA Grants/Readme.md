# Description

The EOSC Future RDA Open Calls provided grants to individuals, research groups, organisations and institutions, to support the creation of diverse outputs to bring data initiatives and experts closer to EOSC. They also served to provide EOSC with tools and standards from the global research data community, ensuring long-term interoperability and standards as well as enabling the accessibility of EOSC and widening engagement via domain ambassadors.

Through these Open Calls, funded by EOSC Future and managed by RDA, financial support was offered for the following categories:

-Calls focused on Optimising (RDA) Open Science Frameworks and Guidelines in the Context of EOSC Uptake
-Call focused on RDA Working Groups for Development of EOSC Solutions
-Call focused on Communities of Practice
-Call focused on Meeting and Conference Support
-Call focused on Standards and Adoption
-Calls focused on Domain Ambassadors (2 editions)
-Call focused on Cross-disciplinary Science Adoption Grants (2 editions)

RDAâ€™s role in EOSC is to enable science communities to leverage connections to RDA so as to create tools for European research infrastructures, via RDA working groups for EOSC solutions, to enable excellent research and access to data and to promote open science practices and standards across disciplines and application domains. Encouraging cross-pollination and identifying synergies between the different open call projects was an important aspect of the support activity. The grantees have an active alumni network that is considering forming itself into an RDA interest group that could serve as a support structure for similar project supported by small-scale grants.
