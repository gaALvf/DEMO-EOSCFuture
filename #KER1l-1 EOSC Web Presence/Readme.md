# Description
The EOSC Portal, accessible at https://eosc-portal.eu/, is a gateway to information and resources in EOSC, providing updates on its governance and players, the projects contributing to its realisation, funding opportunities for EOSC stakeholders, relevant European and national policies, important documents, and recent developments. The EOSC Marketplace, which acts as an entry point to the multitude of services and resources for researchers, can be accessed via the EOSC Portal. Similarly, the EOSC Grants Platform can be accessed via the EOSC Portal. For prospective resource providers and users, the Portal provides training materials and tutorials on how to use its features. The Portal also offers information for potential service providers on how to onboard their services to the EOSC Portal Catalogue & Marketplace. The EOSC Portal also engages the EOSC community and stakeholders. The events and news sections cover relevant updates coming from the expanding EOSC ecosystem. 
The EOSC Portal Website consists of the eosc-portal.eu domain name, the website software (configuration, design and structure), and its content.
The EOSC Marketplace and the EOSC Grants Platform are separate project results of EOSC Future, and are not described further here.
