# Description

This result lists the EOSC Future project deliverables which contain significant exploitable project results. Not all project deliverables are included here: some are confidential and therefore not exploitable; some are progress reports of project work which are not in themselves exploitable even though the work they describe often is. Many of the project deliverables, however, contain significant information which continues to have exploitation potential after the end of the project, and hence are listed here. They do not all pertain to the EOSC Core, but because many of them do, this result is included as part of KER1.
