# Description

Monitoring is the key service needed to gain insights into an infrastructure. It needs to be continuous and on-demand to quickly detect,correlate, and analyse data for a fast reaction to anomalous behaviour. The challenge of this type of monitoring is how to quickly identify and correlate problems before they affect end-users and ultimately the productivity of the organisation. Management teams can monitor the availability and reliability of the services from a high level view down to individual system metrics and monitor the conformance of multiple
SLAs. The EOSC Monitoring service combines two operational monitoring services: the EOSC-CORE and the EOSC-Exchange Monitoring Services, Respectively monitoring the EOSC-Core services (EOSC Core Monitoring) and the services onboarded to the EOSC Service Registry (EOSC-Exchange 
Monitoring).
